This is about a gamified educational app designed to enhance mathematical learning through innovative features such as adaptive learning algorithms, logical puzzles, and daily challenges. The app addresses key gaps in existing solutions, including a lack of personalization, insufficient gamification, and fun, engaging logical content - all in one app. With the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), the app provides an effective learning opportunity, while constantly assisting the user with their questions and adapting on the user's knowledge. It gives an opportunity to identify weaknesses and work on them.
Main features of the app are an innovative gamification system, developed based on similar successful models as Duolingo. It includes XP-based leveling, streaks, rewards that you can use to make some in-app purchases, and leaderboards within your friend - study groups to motivate users for daily progress. Besides, app includes logical puzzles and daily challenges that user can solve daily for fun. Such practice stimulates critical thinking and encourages consistent engagement. Additionally, integrated natural language processing (NLP) ensures multilingual support, making mathing accessible for diverse user groups.
The app's architecture combines a user-friendly frontend with a scalable backend, utilizing efficient database workflows to manage user progress, rewards, and content recommendations. Workflow diagrams and mockups highlight the appâ€™s intuitive design and seamless functionality.
Conducted research demonstrates the app's potential to improve retention, engagement, and conceptual understanding among learners. Furthermore, the study explores the impact of enhanced AI techniques, such as real-time analysis and personalized lesson suggestions, on user satisfaction and learning outcomes.
Future improvements include expanding content libraries, refining AI algorithms for more precise personalization, and ensuring data privacy. This work in general demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of applying technology in education to make math education more fun and easy.
